This project uses the GTP Open API
It lets you enter an Open API key out of STRATUS
Then lets you pick a project, and run package dashboard reports

There is a self-installing version in the install directory.
If you install that, it will copy the software to your desktop
and create a shortcut icon on the desktop pointing to the
program.
